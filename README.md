My website https://janegle.github.io/EduFinderWebsite/ is a marketing site for a product that I built, EduFinder.

There are 2 pages: Home and Demo and you can navigate between them using the 2 buttons at the top.

On the Home page:

Clicking on the button TRY EDUFINDER FOR FREE would direct users to the Demo page.

Clicking on the button CONTACT US would pop up a form for users to fill out name and email address. Upon clicking
Submit, a green message "We'll be in touch shortly!" will appear. Upon clicking x, the message will disappear.

On the Demo page:
There're 2 sample queries: Job Query Sample and Scholarship Query Sample. 
Clicking on each button would display the results.
